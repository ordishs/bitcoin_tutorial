# bitcoin_tutorial

The purpose of this code is to illustrator how to create:

1. Private / public key pairs
2. Bitcoin addresses from public keys
3. Bitcoin transactions

The code is dependant on:

* github.com/bitcoinsv/bsvd - a full bitcoin node implementation in Go
*	github.com/libsv/go-bt - a library for working with bitcoin transactions and scripts
*	github.com/ordishs/go-bitcoin - a Go wrapper around RPC calls to a bitcoin node.

This example assumes you are running bitcoind locally in regtest mode.
